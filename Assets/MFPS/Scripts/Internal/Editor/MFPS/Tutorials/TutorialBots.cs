These bots are primarily designed for the game's core modes like Team DeathMatch and Free For All, as well as certain addon modes.\n\n<size=16><b>AI Behavior and Limitations</b></size>\n\n\nThe AI of these bots is tailored for specific game modes. However, their behavior is not fully adapted for all game modes available in MFPS. For example, in objective-based modes like Capture the Flag, the bots default to basic actions such as seeking and shooting enemies, without engaging in the mode's specific objectives like flag capturing. To have bots function appropriately in these modes, additional AI programming is necessary.\n\n<size=16><b>Bot Prefabs</b></size>\n\n\nMFPS provides default bot prefabs for team-based gameplay, with one prefab for each team. In solo modes, the game uses the prefab for Team 1. Post the MFPS 1.10.0 update, the process of integrating player models for these bots has been streamlined. The same player models used for real player prefabs can now be applied to bot prefabs, eliminating the need for separate integration.");

By default, they can use four types of weapons: Machineguns, Pistols, Shotguns, and Grenades.\n\n<size=16><b>Simplified Weapon Integration (Post 1.10.0 Update)</b></size>\n\n\nStarting from MFPS 1.10.0, integrating weapons directly into each bot prefab is no longer necessary. Instead, bots use the weapons from the linked player prefab. Your task is to specify which weapons from the player prefab are available for the bot's use.\n\n<size=16><b>Setting Up Available Weapons for Bots</b></size>\n\n\nThe process to define the bot's weapon arsenal is straightforward:\n1. <b>Select Bot Prefab</b>:\n  • Locate and select the bot prefab you wish to modify. By default, these are found in the MFPS's Resources folder.\n2. <b>Accessing Weapon Settings</b>:\n  • With the bot prefab selected, navigate to the inspector and find the `<b>bl_AIShooterAttack</b>` component.\n  • Look for the 'Weapons Container' section.\n3. <b>Assigning Weapons</b>:\n  • In the 'Weapons Container', you'll find a list where you can add new entries.\n  • For each new entry, assign the GunID corresponding to the weapon you want to be available for this bot.\n\n<size=16><b>Customizing Weapons for Different Bots</b></size>\n\n\nIf you desire distinct weapon sets for different bots:\n• Assign a unique 'weapon container scriptable object' to each bot prefab. This allows you to have a different array of weapons available for each type of bot, providing more diversity in your game's AI.");

Specifically, check the inspector for the `<b>bl_AIShooterAgent</b>` and `<b>bl_AIShooterAttack</b>` scripts, where the property names indicate their purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the placement of cover points significantly impacts bot behavior and perceived intelligence. Adding cover points in strategic locations on your map can enhance their tactical performance.\n\nFinally, the new <b>AI Areas</b> introduced in MFPS 1.10.0 changes how bots play in team dynamics. When AI Areas are utilized, bots avoid reckless engagements. Instead, they hold positions or find safe spots to shoot from a distance until they can advance.

The AI Manager tracks the number of bots in each grid cell and designates cells with a high concentration of bots as AI Areas.\n\n<size=16><b>How AI Areas are Determined</b></size>\n\n1. <b>Grid System</b>: The map is divided into a grid with each cell having a defined size (cell size). The grid helps in efficiently managing and tracking the positions of bots.\n2. <b>Bot Density Calculation</b>: During each update cycle, the AI Manager counts the number of bots in each grid cell.\n3. <b>Hot Area Threshold</b>: A grid cell is marked as an AI Area if it contains a number of bots equal to or greater than a predefined threshold (e.g., 4 bots).\n4. <b>Team-specific Zones</b>: AI Areas are further categorized based on team presence. For example, an area dominated by bots from Team 1 will be considered a hot zone for Team 2 and vice versa.\n\n<size=16><b>Bot Behavior in AI Areas</b></size>\n\n\nWhen bots approach or detect an AI Area dominated by the enemy team, their behavior is influenced by their `<b>engagementBias</b>` parameter, which determines their tendency to rush into enemy zones or take a more cautious approach:\n• <b>engagementBias</b>: This parameter defined in the bot <b>Behavior Settings</b>, ranges from 0 to 1 and indicates the bot's likelihood of rushing enemy areas (1) versus holding strategic positions (0).
